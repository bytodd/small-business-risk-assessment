# small-business-risk-assessment

This project documents a cybersecurity and operational risk assessment I conducted for a local small business. The goal was to identify vulnerabilities, prioritize risks, and propose mitigation strategies to improve their security posture.

## Background

Since January 2025, I've been working with this local merchant to improve their online presence and develop an e-commerce store for their catering business. When I mentioned I was pivoting into cybersecurity and studying for the Security+ certification, I offered to conduct a risk assessment as a way to apply what I was learning.

## Scope

- Evaluate cyber risks tied to business-critical operations
- Assess technology and on-Premise Exposure
- Recommend pragmatic and budget-conscious security controls

## Workflow
